Required city map backgrounds (PNG) for automatic load in `index.html`:

- `3874_city_viridian.png`
- `3875_city_pewter.png`
- `3876_city_map_3876.png`

Notes:

- The game already runs without these files (fallback tiled rendering).
- If these files are present, the maps above use them automatically as visual backgrounds.
- Keep filenames exactly as listed to avoid remapping.
